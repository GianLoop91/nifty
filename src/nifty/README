This directory is a hot mess right now...

The todo subdirectory has a bunch of random junk from previous Nifty efforts... some files might 
have useful stuff, others might need to be totally redone, and a lot are empty. The main useful
thing is that all the functions we'd like to include in Nifty v1.0 have a named file and that file
exists in either todo or this directory (I believe there are no repeats that are in both todo and
this directory). I'm just gradually pulling out of todo and putting in this folder.

In this folder you'll see some files start with an underscore... these are currently in progress for
the new structure of Nifty. They should be pretty far along too, but might have some real problems 
I'm in the middle of working on. The other files should be pretty much done, just needing formal
testing (they've already had informal) before being ready for Nifty v1.0. There may still be some
TODOs in them, but nothing should be broken.
